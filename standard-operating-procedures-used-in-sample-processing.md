# Standard Operating Procedures Used in Sample Processing

These Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) are available on the **GeneLab Sample Processing Github page -** [**https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing**](https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing).&#x20;

### Tissue Storage and Cutting

*   [**1.1 Sample aliquoting, labeling and storage**](https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/blob/master/SOP\_pdfs/GeneLab%20SOP%201.1%20Sample%20aliquotng%2C%20labeling%20and%20storage.pdf)

    This SOP describes in detail how GeneLab SPL handles sample storage, aliquoting, labeling and the consensus acronyms we use.
*   [**1.2 Frozen tissue cutting**](https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/blob/master/SOP\_pdfs/GeneLab%20SOP%201.2%20Frozen%20tissue%20cutting.pdf)

    This SOP describes the steps required to safely section a tissue prior the extraction of nucleic acids. The procedure, if followed correctly will allow portioning a piece of tissue without thawing and compromising the original biological sample.

### Homogenization

*   [**2.1 Tissue homogenization using Bullet Blender Gold Bead Beater**](https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/blob/master/SOP\_pdfs/GeneLab%20SOP%202.1%20Tissue%20homogenization%20using%20Bullet%20Blender%20Gold%20bead%20beater.pdf)

    This SOP describes the steps required to lyse and homogenize biological material using a Bullet Blender 24 Gold bead beater. This procedure was validated for downstream RNA/DNA extraction using the Qiagen AllPrep kits (SOP#3.1), it is also possible to use the procedure with downstream RNA extraction using Trizol (SOP#3.2).
*   [**2.2 Tissue homogenization using Polytron Rotor Stator Homogenizer**](https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/blob/master/SOP\_pdfs/GeneLab%20SOP%202.2%20Tissue%20homogenization%20using%20Polytron%20Rotor%20Stator%20Homogenizer.pdf)

    This SOP describes the steps required to homogenize biological samples using the handheld rotor stator homogenizer Polytron. This type of homogenator allow for a larger lysis buffer volume and is used mainly for samples that require larger yield and/or not yet optimized for bead homogenization. This procedure is currently routinely used for mouse skin RNA extraction that requires a downstream Trizol extraction (SOP#3.2).

### Extraction

It is strongly advised to read the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini-Handbook in full.
