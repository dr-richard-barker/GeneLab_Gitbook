# Open Science data standards

### Open Science data

To help maximize the value of precious biological spaceflight experiments, GeneLab generates datasets from various spaceflight and spaceflight relevant samples. Upon curation, these data are released immediately to the public through the GeneLab data system. A subset of datasets generated by GeneLab to date can be viewed [here](https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/search\_studies/?q=galazka\&data\_source=cgene).

### Proprietary PI data

GeneLab also provides sequencing services to NASA-funded principal investigators (PIs) whose funding source provides a WBS. Utilizing GeneLab services allows PIs to take advantage of GeneLab’s experience processing space-flown tissues and to harmonize their data by utilizing GeneLab’s standard assays. Moreover, PIs may be able to avoid certain overhead costs so that data may be generated more cost-effectively.

### Standard assays

GeneLab has worked with its [Analysis Working Group](https://genelab.nasa.gov/awg/charter) and Steering Committee to develop a set of sequencing standards. These standards include sample extraction, library generation, internal and external controls and sequencing parameters.

To date, GeneLab has finalized standards for Total RNA-sequencing.

### [Standard operating procedures](broken-reference)

GeneLab uses a compendium of standard operating procedures (SOPs) for processing tissues and other biological samples into molecular analytes for molecular characterization. These protocols are available here [**https://genelab.nasa.gov/genelab-sequencing-services/sops**](broken-reference).
